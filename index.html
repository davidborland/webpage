<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, but moved to The United States of America when I was ten years old.
  I attended Clemson University for my undergraduate degree, obtaining a B.S. (Winter 2000) in
  <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/ces/computing/">Computer Science</a>,
  with an Emphasis Area in Fine Arts and a Minor in Philosophy.
  <br/><br/>
  I obtained my M.S. (Spring 2003) and Ph.D. (Spring 2007)
  in <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu">Computer Science</a> from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
  My advisor was <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~taylorr">Russ Taylor</a>, and my dissertation area was in scientific visualization,
  specifically a new volume visualization technique for medical images called
  <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~taylorr/FORWebPage/">flexible occlusion rendering</a>.  As part of the requirements for fulfulling my
  Ph.D. I was also co-instructor for a graduate-level <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~taylorr/Comp715/">scientific visualization course</a>
  taught at UNC-Chapel Hill and NC A&T.
  <br/><br/>
  From the Summer of 2007 to the Summer of 2010 I was a Senior Visualization Researcher at the Renaissance Computing Institute
  (<a href="http://www.renci.org">RENCI</a>), where I worked with various collaborators, mostly from UNC-Chapel Hill,
  on projects requiring visualization expertise.
  <br/><br/>
  In the Fall of 2010, I began working as a Research Fellow for <a href="http://www.idibaps.org/">IDIBAPS</a> with Mavi Sanchez-Vives and Mel Slater in the 
  <a href="http://www.event-lab.org">Event Lab</a> at the Universitat de Barcelona in Catalunya, Spain, studying the effects and applications of embodiment in
  virtual characters within virtual-reality environments.  In the Spring of 2010, I also became manager of the new
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Automatic_Virtual_Environment">CAVE</a> virtual-reality facility at the Event Lab.
  <br/><br/>
  I returned to RENCI in the Summer of 2012, where I have continued my work as a Senior Visualization Researcher.
  <br/><br/>
  My main areas of research interest include data visualization, computer graphics, virtual reality, image processing and analysis, and haptic interfaces.
